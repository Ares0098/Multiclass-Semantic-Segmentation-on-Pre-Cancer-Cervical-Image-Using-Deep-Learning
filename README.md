# Multiclass-Semantic-Segmentation-on-Pre-Cancer-Cervical-Image-Using-Deep-Learning
Project Detail :
- This project is the final project of my undergraduate education. Its aim is to conduct research on pre cervical cancer objects by applying a semantic segmentation approach using deep learning methods. 
- The objects to be segmented in the images are Lesions, Columnar, Transformation Zone, and Cervical Area.
- The deep learning architecture used is the U-Net architecture, utilizing a Backbone Network from another deep learning architecture.
- Model parameters
  - Epochs: 150
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
  - Learning Rate: 0.0001
- The evaluation metrics used are Intersection Over Union (IoU), Dice Coefficient, and Pixel Accuracy.
